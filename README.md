Bioactivity Drug Discovery
This repository contains code and data related to bioactivity prediction of drug candidate compounds targeting the SARS-CoV replicase polyprotein 1ab. The aim is to determine a suitable conventional machine learning model using the ChEMBL dataset to predict bioactivity values of different compounds.
